# SPDK Trello Boards

SPDK has a team page on [Trello](https://trello.com/spdk) which is organized into the following
types of pages:

* Backlog pages - each page corresponds to a major SPDK feature (or set of related features)
* Community Meeting Agenda page - for posting agenda items for future community meetings
* Detailed feature pages - used to tracking low-level tasks related to implementing an item
  from one of the backlog pages

Card on backlog pages track features or tasks which are not completed, but may be in progress.
These cards are organized into one of four columns, with each column corresponding to a level of
effort.  The level of effort is only an estimate but can be used by SPDK community members to
identify cards suitable for their level of experience and intended time investment.  The four
columns are:

* Low Hanging Fruit (1) - roughly one day for an experienced SPDK developer
* Small (2) - roughly one week
* Medium (3) - roughly one month
* Large (4) - one quarter or more
