  The Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) provides a set of tools and libraries
  for writing high performance, scalable, user-mode storage applications.
  It achieves high performance by moving all of the necessary drivers into userspace
  and operating in a polled mode instead of relying on interrupts,
  which avoids kernel context switches and eliminates interrupt handling overhead.
