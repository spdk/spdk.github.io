      "message": "aria-mtg refers to the Asia community meeting time.  (And since it\u0027s already used above, it actually doesn\u0027t show up when the page is displayed.)\n\nYou\u0027ll also need to edit _includes/js/meetings.js.  Make a new entry called asia-bug-mtg.  Copy the Date data from the aria-mtg, but add 7 to the day (so 19 instead of 12).  Also make it 4, 30, 0 since it starts 30 minutes later.\n\nSee my other e-mail on how to review the results.  You should be able to approve your own patch by going to the link in that e-mail.  If not, have Changpeng or someone approve it for you.",
