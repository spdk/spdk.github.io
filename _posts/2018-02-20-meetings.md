SPDK Community meetings are open to everyone and all are encouraged to
participate. Here are the details:

* Meetings are weekly, alternating time zones to accommodate our global
presence.
* Primary purpose is to cover those things where verbal communication is
easier/more efficient than email or IRC. See the [Community](http://www.spdk.io/community/) page
for details on other communications channels.
* Post any topics on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/DvM7XayJ) prior to the
meeting.
* If we are able to cover the posted topics before the end of the meeting
we can use the time to discuss ad-hoc items.
* Meetings will be hosted with WebEx.

Every other Wed: UTC 04:00-05:00
Every other Thu: UTC 16:00-17:00

THE FIRST MEETING WILL BE THU FEB 22.
