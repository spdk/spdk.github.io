SPDK Community meetings are open to everyone and all are encouraged to
participate. Here are the details:

* Meetings are weekly, alternating time zones to accommodate our global
presence.
* Primary purpose is to cover those things where verbal communication is
easier/more efficient than email or IRC. See the [Community](http://www.spdk.io/community/) page
for details on other communications channels.
* Post any topics on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/DvM7XayJ) prior to the
meeting. If you don't have a Trello login, it's free just sign up and then ask someone on
IRC or on the distribution list to add you to the board.
* If we are able to cover the posted topics before the end of the meeting
we can use the time to discuss ad-hoc items.
* Meetings will be hosted with WebEx every week alternating between Tue UTC 15:00-16:00 and Thu UTC 04:00-5:00.

THE FIRST MEETING WILL BE THU FEB 22.
