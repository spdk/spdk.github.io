This week members of the growing SPDK Community met for the first ever SPDK Developer Meetup. Engineers
from Massachusetts, Arizona, California, Washington, China, Japan and the United Kingdom all came together
in Chandler, AZ, to meet for 2 days of discussions on everything from NVMe to vhost to the community test
strategy, roadmap and upcoming improvements.

forward to more events like this one in 2018, thanks everyone for coming and making it such a great meetup!
