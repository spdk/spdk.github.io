title:  120 Million I/O Per Second with a Standard 2U Intel® Xeon® System
author: John Kariuki

---

In 2013, Intel started the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) project
to reimagine the storage software stack. Although NVMe was still in its infancy,
organizations integrating NVMe SSDs recognized the challenges they faced as the
performance and efficiency of the storage software became increasingly critical
to overall system performance. When Intel kicked off the SPDK Open-Source Community
in 2015, a global phenomenon was born that was laser-focused on demonstrating the
outstanding performance and efficiency enabled by running software designed for
NVMe devices. In the beginning, the community demonstrated that it’s possible to
build systems capable of millions of IOPS (I/O operations per second) using
standard hardware. However, when solid-state media based on technologies like
the Intel® Optane™ arrived, a whole new class of NVMe SSDs with higher throughput
and an order of magnitude reduction in hardware latency the community saw an
opportunity to redesign the SPDK NVMe driver. In 2019, a new SPDK NVMe driver
capable of over 10 million IOPS (using a single CPU core!) was released and
accompanied by a [blog](https://spdk.io/news/2019/05/06/nvme/) with deep technical
insights on the techniques SPDK employs to achieved great performance.
But the SPDK community is about both performance and scalability,
so in 2021 we demonstrated a system that scaled to [80 million IOPS](https://spdk.io/news/2021/05/06/nvme-80m-iops/).
We’re kicking off 2023 with another *mind-blowing* accomplishment.

We built a 2U Intel® Xeon® server system capable of **120 MILLION** 512B random read I/O
operations by combining the latest 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processor
(code-named Sapphire Rapid) with Intel® Optane™ SSDs. The system has 2 CPUs with
80 PCIe Gen 5 lanes each, giving us plenty of PCIe lanes to connect NVMe SSDs and
other I/O devices such as network cards.

## BIG NUMBERS

The graph below demonstrates the I/O throughput scalability of the SPDK NVMe driver with
the addition of more CPU cores to perform I/O. We measured a *stunning* **13.91 MILLION** 512B
I/O per second on 1 CPU core. The IOPS scaled linearly with the addition of CPU cores
until 8 cores. Above 8 CPU cores, the scaling is non-linear as the IOPS approach the limits
of the SSD capabilities. At just 12 I/O processing cores, we measured over **120 MILLION IOPS
at an amazing average latency of just 25.56 microseconds**.

## Is Your Storage Software ready for 120M IOPS?

If you are new to SPDK, you might be asking “where do I find a storage stack
capable of 120 million IOPS?”. The SPDK open-source community provides a set
of BSD licensed tools and libraries for writing high performance, scalable,
user-mode storage applications. From the beginning, the community designed
SPDK for low latency and high throughput “next generation” storage media,
such as Intel® Optane™. There is a lot of reading material over at SPDK’s
[main documentation page](https://spdk.io/doc). In particular, check out
the [Introduction](https://spdk.io/doc/intro.html) and
[Concepts](https://spdk.io/doc/concepts.html) sections for the techniques
and strategies that SPDK employs to achieve great performance.

The bedrock of SPDK is a user space, polled-mode, asynchronous, lockless NVMe
driver that provides zero-copy, highly parallel access directly to an SSD from
a user space application. SPDK further provides a full block stack as a user
space library that performs many of the same operations as a block stack in
an operating system. The community provides NVMe-oF, iSCSI, and vhost target applications
build on top of the driver and block stack that are capable of serving disks
over the network or to other processes. The standard Linux kernel initiators
for NVMe-oF and iSCSI interoperate with these targets, as well as QEMU with vhost.
These servers can be up to an order of magnitude more CPU efficient than
other implementations. These targets can be used as examples of how to implement
a high-performance storage target, or used as the basis for production deployments.

## How’d We Achieve Linear Scalability?

In 2019, the SPDK community optimized the SPDK NVMe driver to achieve over
10 million storage I/O per second from one thread. If you’re not already familiar
with how SPDK was able to hit that goal, you may want to start
[here](https://spdk.io/news/2019/05/06/nvme/). This blog explains the NVMe driver
IOPS scalability.

*The SPDK NVMe driver does not take locks in the I/O path*, so it scales linearly
in terms of performance per thread as long as a queue pair and a CPU core are
dedicated to each new thread. NVMe queue pairs provide parallel submission path
for I/O. Queue pairs contain no locks or atomics, however, so a given queue pair
may only be used by a single thread at a time. The number of queue pairs available
is dictated by the NVMe SSD itself. The NVMe specification allows for up to 65,535
independent I/O queues for submitting I/Os to an NVMe device concurrently, but most
devices support between 32 and 128. Because NVMe devices have many independent
submission queues, organizations developing storage applications with SPDK should
consider organizing their internal data structures such that data is assigned
exclusively to a single thread. All operations that require that data should be
done by sending a request to the owning thread. This results in a
[message passing architecture](https://spdk.io/doc/concurrency.html), as opposed
to a locking architecture, and will result in superior scaling across CPU cores.

*Pinning I/O threads to CPU cores on the same NUMA node as NVMe SSDs* because accessing
local memory is faster than remote memory. SPDK provides the flexibility to configure
storage software to run on CPU core(s) that are on the same NUMA node as the hardware
it will access. DPDK provides NUMA aware memory allocation APIs with allocators that
can maintain a per-core cache. The SPDK nvmeperf benchmarking application uses the
[DPDK Mempool](http://doc.dpdk.org/guides/prog_guide/mempool_lib.html) library which
provides a per-core cache that enables threads to use per-thread local storage
without taking locks.

You can find out more information about the design of the SPDK NVMe driver at the
following [documentation page](https://spdk.io/doc/nvme.html), which includes the
APIs you need to start integrating the driver into your storage application.

## How About 4KB I/Os?

The graph below shows the scaling for 4 KiB random read I/O. We measured 12.51 million
4KiB random read I/O operations per second on a single thread. The IOPS scaled linearly
as we added a second core to 25.48 million IOPS and reached a peak of 37 million IOPS
with 4 CPU cores.

## Test Methodology

* The data was collected using the SPDK NVMe [perf tool](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/blob/master/examples/nvme/perf/perf.c)
  in the examples/nvme/perf directory of the [SPDK repository](https://github.com/spdk/spdk).
  The perf tool was created because off-the-shelf performance tools were not designed to get to this IOPS rate.
  SPDK’s NVMe perf tool has a comparatively reduced feature set, but is designed specifically to get
  to this level of performance.
* The 1 I/O core test was performed using a CPU core on NUMA node 0. However, as we scaled the
  number of I/O cores to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, we ran two nvmeperf processes
  concurrently. Each nvmeperf process was configured to use CPU cores on a single
  NUMA node to read from SSDs on that same NUMA node.
* Each workload was run for 5 minutes and repeated three times at each CPU count.

## Wrapping Up

The SPDK open-source community enables collaboration amongst developers worldwide
to create innovative storage software solutions for a world that increasingly
relies on data. The community follows a fully open development model with all
code BSD licensed, allowing community members to integrate any or all the components
under the most permissive licensing terms. There is an increasing number of companies
and projects contributing to and adopting SPDK to build software-defined storage
solutions for cloud, NAS, and SAN systems. SPDK is the core data-path framework
enabling the emerging xPU-based storage solutions that are based on DPU/IPU-like
technologies.
