On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 18.10](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v18.10)!

This release contains the following new features:

- **Dynamic memory allocation:** SPDK will now automatically utilize DPDK's dynamic memory management with DPDK versions >= 18.05.1.
- **Crypto Virtual Bdev:** A new virtual bdev module has been added to perform at rest data encryption using the DPDK CryptoDev
Framework. It supports software encryption as well as hardware assisted encryption via Intel(R) QAT.
- **jsonrpc-client:** Library intended for issuing RPC commands from applications has been added.
- **SPDKCLI:** Interactive command tool for managing SPDK is no longer considered experimental. Support for the iSCSI and NVMe-oF targets has been added.
- **iSCSI initiator:** The SPDK iSCSI initiator is no longer considered experimental and becomes a first-class citizen among bdev modules.
- **RAID:** The RAID virtual bdev module is no longer considered experimental and is always enabled by default.

Full changelog for this release is available [here](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v18.10).
