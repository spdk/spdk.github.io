title:  "New Core Maintainer - Tomek Zawadzki"
author: Jim Harris

The SPDK project has a team of core maintainers who are responsible for providing
technical oversight for the SPDK project, including final review and merging of
patches into the SPDK code base. As the SPDK project continues to grow, the core
maintainer team also needs to grow by adding contributors who are already
demonstrating technical skill and leadership within the project. So I am pleased
to announce that we are adding Tomasz (Tomek) Zawadzki to the core maintainer team!

Tomek has been a significant contributor to the SPDK community over the last three
years. His code contributions have included SPDK logical volumes, enabling of TCP
stack alternatives such as VPP, as well as fixes and improvements in a wide range
of additional SPDK components and libraries. He has also owned SPDK quarterly
release management over the last year.  Tomek is a key patch reviewer, active in
resolving GitHub issues and prominent in helping users on the mailing list or on
Slack. He is from Intel and based in Gdansk, Poland.

Thanks,

Jim Harris (representing the core maintainer team)
