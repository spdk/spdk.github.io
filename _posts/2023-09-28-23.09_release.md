On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 23.09](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v23.09)!!

This release contains the following new features:

 - **Accel operation chaining NVMe bdev**: The NVMe bdev will now advertise support for accel sequences if the underlying controller supports it.
 - **NVMe-oF TCP data digest chaining**: The NVMe-oF TCP transport will now calculate data digest using the accel sequence APIs if they're available.
 - **JSON-RPC 2.0 client in Go**: Added JSON-RPC 2.0 client written in Go to ease communication with SPDK. Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/blob/v23.09/go/rpc/README.md).
 - **DIF/DIX CRC32/64 support**: Extended util library DIF/DIX support to CRC-32 and CRC-64 format of the Protection Information.
 - **NVMe-oF TCP TLS configuration**: It is now possible to persist NVMe-oF TCP TLS configuration across application restarts.
