Intel is pleased to announce that the Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) project will be
transitioning to the Linux Foundation in 2025. This move aims to ensure the long-term sustainability
and growth of SPDK, fostering a vibrant community and driving innovation in storage performance.

While Intel will be divesting from the project, we remain committed to supporting the community
during this transition. We are actively working with the Linux Foundation to establish a Technical
Steering Committee that will oversee the project's future direction. During the transition period,
there may be some temporary disruptions to services such as code reviews and continuous integration.
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will provide updates on the status of these
services.â€¯Please check back here or on Slack for updates.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the SPDK community for their contributions over
the past decade. Your dedication and hard work have made SPDK a valuable resource for the storage
industry. We wish the SPDK community continued success under the stewardship of the Linux
Foundation.

Thank you,<br />
Bill Pearson, Vice President, Intel Data Center & AI Group<br />
