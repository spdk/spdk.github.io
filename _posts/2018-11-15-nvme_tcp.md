title:  "SPDK NVMe-oF TCP Transport"

NVM Express has ratified TCP as a new transport for NVMe-oF!  The announcement can be
found [here](https://nvmexpress.org/welcome-nvme-tcp-to-the-nvme-of-family-of-transports/).
Quoting from the NVM Express announcement:

> Whatâ€™s really exciting about NVMe/TCP is that it enables efficient end-to-end NVMe
> operations between NVMe-oF host(s) and NVMe-oF controller devices interconnected by
> any standard IP network with excellent performance and latency characteristics. This
> allows large-scale data centers to utilize their existing ubiquitous Ethernet
> infrastructure with multi-layered switch topologies and traditional Ethernet network
> adapters. NVMe/TCP is designed to layer over existing software based TCP transport
> implementations as well as future hardware accelerated implementations.

Ziye Yang has been actively working on SPDK support for NVMe-oF TCP, and has a
[patch](https://review.gerrithub.io/#/c/spdk/spdk/+/425191/) that is now available for
testing.  This patch adds NVMe-oF TCP support to both the SPDK NVMe-oF target as well
as the SPDK NVMe host initiator.  This support will likely be merged in the next
couple of weeks, so we welcome any code review or testing feedback!
