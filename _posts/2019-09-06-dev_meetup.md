Come and join the 3rd annual SPDK Developer Meet-up, this year hosted by Nutanix in beautiful San Jose CA! It’s an excellent opportunity for networking, learning and making forward progress on the code and generally making the community more productive. We’ll be covering all sorts of topics so there's sure to be something for everyone!

There will only be a few presentations at this meeting, please come prepared for the following types of activities:

* A few pre-planned technical introductory interactive presentations (optional) for contributors who are relatively new and looking to tie together some concepts that they either read about or worked with in the code.
* Open discussion / brainstorming new features or process improvements
* White board design work
* Code walkthroughs
* Focused work on getting specific patches approved

We'll kick off the meeting with some agenda building work and then break off in as many groups as makes sense based on the topics that have the most interest.

Seating is extremely limited so please RSVP as soon as possible!! We need to limit attendance to 2 engineers per company with a few exceptions (for those working on large SPDK patches already) so please consider sending only those who are active in the code base.

This year we’ll start Monday mid-morning to accommodate early travel and go through end of day Tuesday.  There will be snacks provided by Nutanix and we'll have a team dinner Monday evening (location TBD).
