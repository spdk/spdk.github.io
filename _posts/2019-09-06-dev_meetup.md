title:  "Announcing the 2019 SPDK Developer Meetup Hosted by Nutanix"

Come and join the 3rd annual SPDK Developer Meet-up, this year hosted by Nutanix in beautiful San Jose, CA!
It’s an excellent opportunity for networking, learning, coding, and generally strengthening the community.
We’ll be covering all sorts of topics so there's sure to be something for everyone!

There will be very few presentations at this meeting. Instead, you can expect the following types of activities:

* A few pre-planned technical introductory interactive presentations (optional) for contributors who are
relatively new and looking to tie together some concepts that they either read about or worked with in the code.
* Open discussion / brainstorming of new features or process improvements
* White board design work
* Code walkthroughs
* Focused work on getting specific patches approved

We'll kick off the meeting with some agenda building work and then break off in as many groups as makes sense
based on the topics that have the most interest.

Seating is extremely limited so please RSVP as soon as possible!! We need to limit attendance to 2 engineers per
company with a few exceptions (for those working on large SPDK patches already) so please consider sending only
those who are active in the code base.

This year we’ll start Monday mid-morning to accommodate early travel and go through end of day Tuesday.  There
will be snacks provided by Nutanix and we'll have a team dinner Monday evening (location TBD).
