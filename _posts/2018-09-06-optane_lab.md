Intel and Packet are working together to bring free infrastructure for testing and benchmarking with Intel® Optane™ SSDs to the developer community.  This community lab is a perfect fit for the SPDK community that cares about getting the most from their storage applications.  Interested in testing your SPDK application on the world’s most responsive data center SSD?  Head over to [Accelerate with Optane](https://www.acceleratewithoptane.com/) for more information, and, once you’re ready, [request access](https://github.com/AccelerateWithOptane/lab/issues).  The lab will provide you with a highly capable bare metal server powered by Intel Xeon® Scalable processors, with three 750GB Intel Optane™ SSD DC P4800X and one 4TB Intel SSD DC P4500 for comparison purposes.

Due to high demand, priority will be made for teams most interested in sharing their results and learning with the SPDK and broader open source communities that care about application performance.  Take advantage of this resource to prepare for the next SPDK Developer Meetup October 16-17 and/or share your results on your own channels.
