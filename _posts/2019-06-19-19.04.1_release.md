On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 19.04.1](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v19.04.1)!

### NVMe-oF
Increased default maximum number of queue pairs to 128 in order to match Linux kernel target. Users can still decrease this default when creating the transport (i.e. -p option for nvmf_create_transport in rpc.py).

Shared receive queue can now be disabled even for NICs that support it using the `nvmf_create_transport` RPC method parameter `no_srq`. The actual use of a shared receive queue is predicated on hardware support when this flag is not used.

### iSCSI
Fixed hang on high QD large reads.

### DPDK
Added DPDK 19.05 support.

### raid bdev
Fixed race when issuing multiple destroy RPC for the same raid bdevs.

### GitHub issues
- **#798:** rpc: fix segfault on get_spdk_version request with extra params
- **#789:** test/json_config: wait for clean config
- **#279:** blobfs: ensure length xattr is written even if all data is flushed
- **#777:** test/raid: switch from config file to RPC
- **#781:** build: add full version to SONAME for shared libraries
- **#801:** test/lvol: wait for bdevs to be examined

Thanks to everyone for your contributions, participation, and effort!
