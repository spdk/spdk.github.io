The SPDK project has a team of core maintainers who are responsible for providing
technical oversight for the SPDK project, including final review and merging of
patches into the SPDK code base. The core maintainer team looks to add to its
team with contributors who are demonstrating technical skill and
leadership within the project over an extended period of time. So we are
pleased to announce that we are adding Jacek Kalwas to the core
maintainer team!

Jacek has been a key contributor to SPDK over the last 6 years with over
300 patches in a wide range of components, including the nvmf target,
nvme driver, and socket, bdev and accel libraries. Jacek is from Nutanix and
is based in Gdansk, Poland.

Thanks,

Jim Harris (representing the core maintainer team)
