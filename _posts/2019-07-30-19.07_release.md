On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 19.07](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v19.07)!

This release contains the following features:

- **NVMe-oF FC Transport:** A Fibre Channel transport that supports Broadcom HBAs has been added. This feature is considered as experimental.
- **VMD:** Added Intel Volume Management Device (VMD) driver. VMD is an integrated controller inside the CPU PCIe root complex. It enables virtual HBAs for the connected NVMe SSDs. This feature is considered as experimental.
- **NVMe-oF Persistent reservation:** Persistent reservation emulation has been added to the NVMe-oF target. Persistent reservation state is stored in a JSON file on the local filesystem between target restart.
- **Bdev:** Added bdev layer functions allowing for I/O with metadata being transferred in separate buffer.
- **VPP:** Added support for VPP 19.04.2. Socket abstraction layer now uses VPP session API.
- **OCF:** Added support for OCF 19.3.2. Added Write-Back mode support, persistent cache metadata and caching multiple devices on single cache device. 
- **DPDK:** Added support for DPDK 19.05. By default, SPDK will now rely on upstream DPDK's rte_vhost instead of its fork located inside SPDK repo.

The full changelog for this release is available [here](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v19.07).
