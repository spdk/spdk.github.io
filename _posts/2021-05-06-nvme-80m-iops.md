title:  What? 80 Million I/O Per Second with a Standard 2U Intel® Xeon® System!
author: John Kariuki

The adoption of NVM Express® SSDs in the data center is unleashing performance
that was unprecedented just a few years ago. Since the inception of the SPDK project,
the community has demonstrated that it’s possible to build systems capable of
tens of millions of IOPS (I/O operations per second) using commodity hardware.
Over the last couple of years, we have demonstrated systems capable of over
10 million IOPS (using a single CPU core!), but now we’re ready to significantly
advance the state of the art. Yes, 80 Million IOPS.

We built a 2U Intel® Xeon® server system capable of **80 MILLION** 512B random read
I/O operations by combining the latest 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processor
(code-named Ice Lake) with Intel® Optane™ SSDs. The system has 2 CPUs with 64 PCIe
Gen 4 lanes each, giving us plenty of PCIe lanes to connect NVMe SSDs and other
I/O devices such as network cards.

## BIG NUMBERS

The graph below demonstrates the I/O throughput scalability of the SPDK NVMe driver
with the addition of more CPU cores to perform I/O. We measured a stunning **13.85 MILLION**
512B I/O per second on 1 CPU core. The IOPS scaled linearly with the addition of CPU cores
until 4 cores. Above 4 CPU cores, the scaling is non-linear as the IOPS approach
the limits of the SSD capabilities. At just 8 I/O processing cores,
we measured over **80 MILLION IOPS at an amazing average latency of just 25.54 microseconds**.

## Is Your Storage Software ready for 80M IOPS?

One of the major challenges that organizations integrating NVMe SSDs face is the performance
and efficiency of the storage software is increasingly critical to the overall storage system
performance. Combining the latest Xeon Scalable processor platform with Intel® Optane™ SSDs
may strain even flash-optimized architectures.
If you are new to SPDK, you might be asking “where do I find a storage stack capable of
80 million IOPS?”. The Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK) provides a set of open-source
tools and libraries for writing high performance, scalable, user-mode storage applications.
SPDK was designed from the beginning to support what we call “next generation” storage media,
such as Intel® Optane™ devices. Designing for low latency and high throughput is what this
project is all about. There is a lot of reading material over at SPDK’s [main documentation page](https://spdk.io/doc).
In particular, check out the [Introduction](https://spdk.io/doc/intro.html)
and [Concepts](https://spdk.io/doc/concepts.html) sections.

The bedrock of SPDK is a user space, polled-mode, asynchronous, lockless NVMe driver that
provides zero-copy, highly parallel access directly to an SSD from a user space application.
Two years ago, the SPDK community highly optimized the SPDK NVMe driver to achieve over
10 million IOPS from one thread. We published a [blog](https://spdk.io/news/2019/05/06/nvme/)
that explains the techniques and strategies used to achieve great performance.
Additionally, the SPDK NVMe driver achieves linear IOPS scalability because there are
no locks in the I/O path and pinning I/O threads to CPU cores keeps data the caches of
the CPU cores accessing it.

You can find out more information about the design of the SPDK NVMe driver at the
following [documentation page](https://spdk.io/doc/nvme.html), which includes the APIs
you need to start integrating the driver into your storage application.

## How About 4KB I/Os?

The graph below shows the scaling for 4KiB random read I/O.
We measured 12.62 million 4KiB random read I/O operations per second on a single thread.
The IOPS scaled linearly as we added a second core to 25.17 million IOPS.

## Test Methodology

* The data was collected using the SPDK NVMe [perf tool](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/blob/master/examples/nvme/perf/perf.c)
  in the examples/nvme/perf directory of the SPDK repository. The perf tool was created because
  off-the-shelf performance tools were not designed to get to this IOPS rate. SPDK’s NVMe perf
  tool has a comparatively reduced feature set, but is designed specifically to get to this
  level of performance.
* The 1 I/O core test was performed using a CPU core on NUMA node 0. However, as we scaled the
  number of I/O cores to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, we evenly split the CPU cores between the 2 NUMA
  nodes and configured the perf jobs to use SSDs on the same NUMA node as the CPU cores running perf jobs.
* Each workload was run for 5 minutes and repeated three times at each CPU count.

## Wrapping Up

SPDK is enabling best-in-class performance via a growing list of open source libraries and
applications covering storage, storage networking, and storage virtualization.
SPDK follows a fully open development model with all code BSD licensed, allowing community
members to integrate any or all the components under the most permissive licensing terms.
There is an increasing number of companies and projects contributing to and adopting SPDK
to take advantage of the advancements in NVMe solid state media in hyper converged and disaggregated
storage usage models. Join the [SPDK open source community's](https://spdk.io/community/)
pursuit to build storage software for systems capable of 100 million IOPS!
