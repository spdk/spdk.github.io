Thank you all for attending the SPDK Summit.
We had a very successful SPDK summit this year with awesome content and presenters.

The presentations for day 1 and day 2 of the event are now available: [2018 SPDK US Summit presentations](../../../../../summit/us/2018/)

Please note these are static PDFs, but many of the presentations made extensive use of animations,
so something may be lost in translation.

Links to the videos will be posted separately in 2 weeks.
Please look for notifications on mailing list and at [@SPDKProject](https://twitter.com/SPDKProject)
and the [#SPDKSummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPDKSummit) hashtag on Twitter when links are made available.
