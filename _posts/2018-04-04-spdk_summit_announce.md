The 2018 annual Storage Performance Development Kit US Summit is a great
opportunity to meet with other SPDK community members and listen to a series
of talks from SPDK users and developers. Everything from case studies, to
performance analysis, to tech tutorials, and live demos will be presented.
Further, this year we will dedicate a second day entirely to developers that
will include a hands-on lab as well as a few hours set aside for active
contributors to tackle design issues and discuss future advancements.

## FAQ

### Why should I attend?

If you were at the event last year, you won’t want to miss this year’s summit
as the progress that the community has made over the past 12 months is nothing
short of astonishing! The SPDK Community has grown significantly along
multiple vectors:

- Innovative, new modules promoting performance and efficiency across a range of new use cases
- Full transparency in both planning and development including use of tools such as GerritHub, Jenkins & Trello
- Expanded development communications channels including IRC, world time zone friendly community meetings, and face to face developer meet-ups
- Many new contributors and some additional maintainers!

You won’t want to miss an all new series of talks from users and developers;
everything from case study analysis to technical tutorials. And this year
we’re dedicating a second day just for developers that will include a hands-on
lab as well as a few hours set aside for active contributors who want to take
advantage of having all the expertise in one room to tackle design issues and
discuss future advancements.

Please take advantage of this opportunity to network with the SPDK community!
