This will be a great opportunity to meet with other SPDK community members and listen to a new series
of talks from SPDK users and developers; everything from case studies and analysis to tech tutorials

Why should you attend?

If you were at the event last year, you won’t want to miss this year’s Summit as the progress that the
community has made over the past 12 months is nothing short of astonishing! The SPDK Community has grown
significantly along multiple vectors:

- Innovative new modules promoting performance and efficiency in all new use cases
- New contributors, additional maintainers
- Full transparency in both planning and development including use of tools such as GerritHub, Jenkins & Trello
- Expanded development communications channels including IRC, world time zone friendly community meetings and
face to face developer meet-ups

You won’t want to miss an all new series of talks from users and developers; everything from case study analysis
to technical tutorials.  And this year we’re dedicating a second day just for developers that will include a
hands-on lab as well as a few hours set aside for active contributors who want to take advantage of having all
the expertise in one room to tackle design issues and discuss future advancements.
