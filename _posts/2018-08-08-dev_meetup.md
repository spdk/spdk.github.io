title:  "Announcing the 2018 SPDK Developer Meetup hosted by NetApp"

Come and join the 2nd annual SPDK Developer Meetup, this year hosted by NetApp in beautiful Sunnyvale CA! It’s an excellent opportunity for networking, learning and making forward progress on the code and generally making the community more productive. We’ll be covering all sorts of topics but a major theme this year will be NVMeOF (including FC support) so if you’re interested in these topics you won’t want to miss this meet-up.

There will only be a few presentations at this meeting, please come prepared for the following types of activities:

* A few pre-planned technical introductory interactive presentations (optional) for contributors who are relatively new and looking to tie together some concepts that they either read about or worked with in the code.
* Open discussion / brainstorming new features or process improvements
* White board design work
* Code walkthroughs
* Focused work on getting specific patches approved

We'll kick off the meeting with some agenda building work and then break off in as many groups as makes sense based on the topics that have the most interest.

Seating is extremely limited so please RSVP as soon as possible!! We need to limit attendance to 2 engineers per company with a few exceptions (for those working on large SPDK patches already) so please consider sending only those who are active in the code base.

This year we’ll start first thing Tue morning so please plan travel for Monday.  Intel will be hosting a dinner Tue evening and we’ll be wrapping up mid-afternoon on Wed to accommodate those looking to catch an early evening flight on Wed.  If are you are unsure if this meetup is right for you (it's not a traditional conference style setting) please contact me directly at the email below.
