We are rescheduling the SPDK, PMDK and VTuneâ„¢ Profiler Summit for later in 2020
due to the continued concern over the spread of the coronavirus.

If you have registered and made hotel reservations, we will cancel the hotel
reservation and send you an email next week.

Thank you for your understanding.

If you have any questions, please contact Yuri Ramirez at yuri.w.ramirez@intel.com
