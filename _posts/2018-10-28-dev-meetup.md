This year NetApp hosted the SPDK Developer Meetup in beautiful Sunnyvale CA on 10/16 and 10/17.  HUGE thanks to
John Meneghini and the rest of the NetApp crew.  We had community members from all over the world present with
a record breaking attendance of over 30 developers!

We followed the same model we did last year, building our agenda dynamically based on the what everyone thought
was most interesting to discuss.  Below are the topics we covered this year:

- NVMe-oF
	- Fibre Channel
	- TCP
	- RDMA Error Handling
	- Hardware offloads
- Virtualization (vhost/QEMU)
- Continuous Integration
- Release Management
- Open Channel SSD
- Algorithm offloads
- Encryption, Compression
- Threading changes
- DPDK submodule
- Event tracing
- Performance statistics
- Roadmap

The meetup was such a success that we're considering moving to a bi-annual schedule.  Stay tuned for more information in Q1 of next year!
