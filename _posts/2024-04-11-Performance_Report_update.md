We would like to announce the integration of Accelerated Receive Flow Steering (aRFS) results into
our 24.01 SPDK TCP NVMe-oF 24.01 performance report document (Mellanox ConnectX-5 Ex version).
We have added data showcasing aRFS's impact on NVMe-oF TCP performance - throughput, latency and
CPU utilization.

You can find the updated report document [here](https://spdk.io/doc/performance_reports.html).
