Today, the SPDK team is proud to announce the [v18.04 release](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v18.04).

This release contains the following new features:

- **iSCSI target integration with VPP Userspace TCP/IP:** The SPDK iSCSI target now supports the fd.io Vector Packet Processing (VPP) framework userspace TCP/IP stack.
- **Logical Volume Snapshot/Clone:** Users may create snapshots of existing logical volumes and clones of existing snapshots.
- **Bdev QoS:** Enforcement of IOPS limits for quality of service (QoS) has been added to the bdev layer. This capability will enable congestion management by throttling I/Os to block devices at the QoS rate.
- **Vhost:** The SPDK vhost-scsi, vhost-blk and vhost-nvme applications have fixes to address the DPDK rte_vhost vulnerability [CVE-2018-1059](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2018-1059). Please see this [security advisory](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-1059) for additional information on the DPDK vulnerability.
- **Unified Target Application:** A new unified SPDK target application has been added. This application combines the functionality of iSCSI target, NVMe-oF target, and vhost target.
- **Virtio Block device:** A userspace driver for Virtio Block devices has been added.
- **Virtio with 2MB hugepages:** Enables SPDK Virtio to work with 2MB hugepages.

Also, we have added the following experimental features:
- **iSCSI Initiator:** A SPDK iSCSI initiator bdev module has been added.
- **Vhost NVMe:** Support for vhost-nvme has been added to the SPDK vhost target.
- **SPDKCLI:** Interactive command tool for managing SPDK is available.
- **NVMe CMB:** Support for WDS and RDS capable CMBs in NVMe controllers has been added.
- **RPC:** Partial JSON configuration save/load support has been added to several subsystems.
