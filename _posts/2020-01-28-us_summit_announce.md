This will be a great opportunity to meet with the SPDK, PMDK, and VTune user communities
and listen to a new series of talks from early adopters and long term users.
Topics will include case studies, deep dives, and tech tutorials.
There will also be live demos, hands on labs, and “Meet the Experts”
sessions for informal technical discussions with the experts.

## What is PMDK?

[PMDK](https://pmem.io/pmdk) is a vendor-neutral, growing collection of
libraries started by Intel, motivated by the introduction of
[Optane DC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-dc-persistent-memory.html)
persistent memory. PMDK will work with any persistent memory that provides the
[SNIA NVM Programming Model](https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/technical_work/final/NVMProgrammingModel_v1.2.pdf).
These libraries have been developed for various use cases, tuned, validated to
production quality, and thoroughly documented.

## What is Intel® VTune™ Amplifier?
[Intel® VTune™ Amplifier](https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune) collects key
profiling data needed to optimize modern polled I/O that uses SMDK or PMDK.
It also has analyses to optimize the use and configuration of the latest
Intel® Optane™ DC persistent memory. Also featuring [Intel® Inspector - Persistence
Inspector](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/detect-persistent-memory-programming-errors-with-intel-inspector-persistence-inspector).
