The 2019 Storage Performance Development Kit PRC Summit is a great
opportunity to meet SPDK community members and listen to a new series of talks
from users, adopters, and developers. Topics will include upcoming features,
case studies and analysis, customer sharings, demos, and hands on labs.
This is also good chance to "Meet the Experts" for deep dives discussions,
to tackle design issues and processes, and to discuss future efforts in an informal setting.

This year we're excited to welcome developers from the [PMDK](https://pmem.io/pmdk)
and [VTune](http://vtune.intel.com/) communities to the summit, including
presentations and demos focused on those projects. The summit will include
multiple tracks to accomodate the additional talks.

We hope to see you there!

[SNIA NVM Programming Model](https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/technical_work/final/NVMProgrammingModel_v1.2.pdf).
These libraries have been developed for various use cases, tuned, validated to
production quality, and thoroughly documented
