The SPDK project has a team of core maintainers who are responsible
for providing technical oversight for the SPDK project.
I am pleased to announce that we are adding Shuhei Matsumoto and
Changpeng Liu to the core maintainer team!

Shuhei is from Hitachi and has been a key developer on the SPDK
iSCSI and SCSI libraries, driving a huge number of improvements
in these areas since starting with the SPDK project earlier this
year.
Changpeng is from Intel and has been contributing to SPDK since the
project started in 2015.  He has contributed to a wide variety of
SPDK libraries and applications, including the nvme driver and
extending SPDK vhost support for virtio-blk.

To Shuhei and Changpeng, thank you for all of your focus and
insight â€“ and congratulations!

section of the development page for further details on the core
maintainer team and their responsibilities.
