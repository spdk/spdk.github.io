On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 19.10](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v19.10)!

This release contains the following new features:

- **Zoned bdev API:** Zoned bdev is an extension of the bdev interface. Generic concept comes from ATA/SCSI and is also being worked as an NVMe TP. It will allow to use existing bdev infrastructure for new type zoned of devices.
- **Opal bdev:** A new opal bdev has been added to support management of NVMe self-encrypting drives through the Opal specification. This feature is considered as experimental.
- **NVMe character device:** Added NVMe character device implementation based on CUSE library. It allows creation of NVMe device nodes in Linux kernel for the controller and namespaces. This feature is considered as experimental.
- **Blobfs mount via RPC:** Added mounting blobfs to path on host using RPC.
- **OCF:** Added support for OCF v19.06. Added write-only, write-invalidate and write-around mode support.
- **DPDK:** Added support for DPDK 19.08.
- **RPC names:** Names of RPC calls streamlined between different components. Previous RPC names are available, but will be deprecated.
