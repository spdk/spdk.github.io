title:  "New Core Maintainer - Darek Stojaczyk"

The SPDK project has a team of core maintainers who are responsible for providing technical
oversight for the SPDK project, including final review and merging of patches into the SPDK
code base.  As the SPDK project continues to grow, the core maintainer team needs to grow as
well.  With that in mind, I am pleased to announce that we are adding Dariusz (Darek)
Stojaczyk to the core maintainer team!

Darek has made vast contributions to both the SPDK community and its code base.  He has
assumed a lead role in development of the SPDK vhost target and virtio polled mode drivers,
as well as keeping SPDK in sync with DPDK (including the recent changes to enable dynamic
memory management).  Darek is an active member of the community - providing valuable patch
reviews, GitHub issue resolutions, and copious activity on IRC #spdk as “darsto”.  He is
from Intel, based in Gdansk, Poland, and has been contributing to SPDK since early 2017.

Thanks,

Jim Harris (representing the core maintainer team)
