We are happy to announce the 2025 SPDK Developer Meetup hosted at Nutanix offices in Cambridge, UK! The meetup will be Thursday and Friday, November 6 and 7, 2025.

SPDK Developer Meetups are a great opportunity to network with other SPDK contributors, discuss new or ongoing SPDK feature development, learn about SPDK and to build the SPDK community.

Meetups are relatively informal but highly technical, working through a broad range of agenda items including the following:

- Introductory presentations on the technical topics for solidifying understanding of key concepts especially for new contributors to certain areas of SPDK
- Open discussions and brainstorming sessions on new features or process improvements
- Collaborative whiteboard design work
- Code walkthroughs
- Focused time on specific patchsets to accelerate progress

We typically start day 1 with a session on building the agenda for the meetup. If you have specific topics you are interested in presenting or having others present, it is helpful to reach out to the organizers ahead of time.

Seating is somewhat limited, so please RSVP as soon as possible to secure your seats at the meetup. Attendance will initially be restricted to 2 engineers per company, with exceptions for those actively contributing to SPDK.
