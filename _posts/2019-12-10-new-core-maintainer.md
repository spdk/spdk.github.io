title:  "New Core Maintainer - Alexey Marchuk"
author: Jim Harris

The SPDK project has a team of core maintainers who are responsible for providing
technical oversight for the SPDK project, including final review and merging of
patches into the SPDK code base. As the SPDK project continues to grow, the core
maintainer team also needs to grow by adding contributors who are already
demonstrating technical skill and leadership within the project. So I am pleased
to announce that we are adding Alexey Marchuk to the core maintainer team!

Alexey has been a key contributor to SPDK with a special focus on the NVMe-oF
target (including RDMA and TCP transports) and DIF.  The core maintainers have
increasingly relied on Alexey for his expert reviews as the SPDK NVMe-oF target
gains broader adoption in the industry.  Alexey has been active in resolving
GitHub issues and is prominent in helping users on the mailing list and Slack.
He is from Mellanox and based in Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia.

Thanks,

Jim Harris (representing the core maintainer team)
