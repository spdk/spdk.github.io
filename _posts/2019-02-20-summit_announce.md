The 2019 Storage Performance Development Kit US Summit is a great
opportunity to meet SPDK community members and listen to a new series of talks
from users, adopters, and developers. Topics will include upcoming features,
case studies and analysis, and hands on labs. There will also be "Meet the
Experts" sessions to allow for deep dives, to tackle design issues and
processes, and to discuss future efforts in an informal setting.

This year we're excited to welcome developers from the [PMDK](https://pmem.io/pmdk)
and [VTune](http://vtune.intel.com/) communities to the summit, including
presentations and demos focused on those projects. The summit will include
multiple tracks to accommodate the additional talks.

We hope to see you there!

libraries started by Intel, motivated by the introduction of
[Optane DC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-dc-persistent-memory.html)
persistent memory. PMDK will work with any persistent memory that provides the
[SNIA NVM Programming Model](https://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/technical_work/final/NVMProgrammingModel_v1.2.pdf).
These libraries have been developed for various use cases, tuned, validated to
production quality, and thoroughly documented

## What is VTune Performance Profiler?
[VTune](https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune) is a comprehensive tool for
measuring and observing the performance characteristics of the entire platform
and software stack. VTune features support for next generations platforms, with
early support for new hardware features and technologies. It also features
[Persistence Inspector](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/detect-persistent-memory-programming-errors-with-intel-inspector-persistence-inspector).
