On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 19.01](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v19.01)!

This release contains the following new features:

- **FTL:** Added flash translation layer module allowing for using Open Channel SSDs as block devices. The module is split into the library (located in lib/ftl) and bdev_ftl(lib/bdev/ftl). Please see [documentation](https://spdk.io/doc/ftl.html) for more details. This feature is considered as experimental.
- **OCF_bdev:** New virtual bdev module based on [Open CAS Framework](https://open-cas.github.io/) has been added. This provides a high performance block storage caching on top of any underlying bdev. This feature is considered as experimental.
- **ISA-L:** ISA-L has been added as an SPDK submodule. ISA-L is enabled by default on x86 architecture to accelerate algorithms such as CRC for iSCSI and NVMe-oF.
- **TCP/IP transport:** New TCP/IP transport can now be used in NVMe-oF target and NVMe driver.
- **DIF/DIX library:** New DIF APIs has been added to generate and verify DIF by byte granularity for both DIF and DIX formats.

The full changelog for this release is available [here](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v19.01).
