 - **Improved bdev and bdev/nvme thread synchronization**: Reduced locking cases by half, several races identified and fixed
 - **Hot remove support for uring and aio bdev modules**
 - **Write uncorrectable command support**: Support added to the bdev layer, and plumbed through the bdev/nvme module
