Interested in learning more about SPDK? Want to learn how it can help
accelerate your storage solutions? Attend the SPDK summit and discover all
there is to know about SPDK.

New to SPDK? We have various sessions on the agenda that introduce you to the
project. There is also a hands on lab where you learn as you code.

Already an avid SPDK developer or user? Great! Participate in our developer's
meetup to brainstorm and share ideas to improve the project as well as discuss
new features, concepts and BKMs.

The event kicks off with a key note from the Intel® Corporation Data Center
Group Vice President, Jennifer Huffstetler. The agenda continues with an
awesome line up which includes talks from various SPDK community members
(Alibaba, eBay, Oracle, Cisco, Nutanix) who are eager to share their
experience, learning, challenges and successes with SPDK. SPDK developers will
present new content on various SPDK features highlighting their use cases and
benefits. You will also get to see SPDK in action with live demos and a
hands-on lab.
