On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 19.04](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v19.04)!

This release contains the following new features:

- **Compression bdev:** Added "reduce" block compression scheme based on using SSDs for storing compressed blocks of storage and persistent memory for metadata.
- **Notification:** Added the notify library that provides a high performance local event bus between libraries. Example usage was added to bdev module, which reports notifications for added and removed bdevs via RPC.
- **NVMe:** Opal support was added for scan, take ownership, revert TPer, and dumping device info. The nvme_manage tool can be used to perform these operations.
- **OCF:** Added support for caching multiple bdevs using a single bdev as a cache.
- **DIF pass-through in the NVMe-oF target:** DIF setting of the allocated bdevs can be exposed to the NVMe-oF initiator and data with DIF from the NVMe-oF initiator can be passed through to the allocated bdevs.
- **vhost:** Added experimental support for running with the external, upstream rte_vhost library.

The full changelog for this release is available [here](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v19.04).
