On behalf of the SPDK community, I'm proud to announce the release of
[SPDK v24.09](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v24.09)!

This release contains several new features:
 - **fsdev library**: added the fsdev library providing a filesystem abstraction,
 - **virtio-fs/vfio-user target**: added support for virtio-fs over vfio-user,
 - **NVMe-oF TCP interrupt mode**: the NVMe-oF target now supports interrupt mode with TCP transport,
 - **better NUMA awareness**: NVMe controllers can report NUMA node they're closest to,
 - **NVMe-oF in-band reauthentication**: it's possible to change DH-HMAC-CHAP keys and force
   reauthentication on all existing connections,
 - **DIX support in accel**: added support for executing DIX (Data Integrity Extension) operations
   using accel framework,
 - **bdev_compress algorithm configuration**: compression algorithm and level can be configured.
