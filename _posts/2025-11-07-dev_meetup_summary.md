This year Nutanix hosted the 5th SPDK Developer Meetup in Cambridge, UK.
The event was a great success, attracting around 30 attendees from 11 different companies.
The agenda was packed with a variety of activities, including technical
presentations, open discussions, and collaborative whiteboard design work.
Attendees had the opportunity to network, learn, and contribute to the growth of the SPDK community.
