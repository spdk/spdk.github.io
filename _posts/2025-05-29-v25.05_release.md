On behalf of the SPDK community, I'm proud to announce the release of
[SPDK v25.05 LTS](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v25.05)!

This release is a Long Term Support (LTS) version and will be supported until SPDK v26.01 LTS.
The next SPDK release, v25.09, is planned for the end of September.

This release brings several major features and improvements:
 - **NVMe PCIe Interrupt Mode**: The NVMe library and NVMe bdev module now support
 interrupt mode for PCIe transport in the primary process.
 - **DIF Insert and Strip**: The bdev layer can now generate and verify data integrity by
 inserting and stripping DIF from I/O.
 - **mlx5 Accel Platform Driver**: Adds a new mlx5 platform driver capable of offloading
 the execution of a sequence of RDMA_READ/RDMA_WRITE and encrypt/decrypt operations in a single step.

You can view the full changelog [here](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v25.05).
Deprecation notices for users upgrading from previous releases are available
