This year Intel hosted the 4th SPDK Developer Meetup in Gdansk, Poland.
The event was a great success, attracting around 30 attendees from 7 different companies.
The agenda was packed with a variety of activities, including technical
presentations, open discussions, and collaborative whiteboard design work.
Attendees had the opportunity to network, learn, and contribute to the growth of the SPDK community.

Topics discussed this year are documented on the [SPDK DevMeetup '24](https://github.com/orgs/spdk/projects/6) board,
and many already had follow-up discussions on the weekly [Community Meetings](https://spdk.io/community/#meetings).

The event was a huge hit, and we look forward to more in the future!
