# Enhancement Requests

# Community Meetings

SPDK Community Meetings are weekly calls open to everyone and all are encouraged to
participate. The primary purpose is to cover topics where verbal communication
is more efficient than Slack. The meetings are hosted using Zoom.

Please see the bottom of this [page](#holidays) for holidays when regularly
scheduled community meetings will be cancelled.

Please post proposed topics on the SPDK Community Meeting
[board](https://github.com/orgs/spdk/projects/8/views/1?pane=info) prior to the meeting. If we are able to cover the
posted topics before the end of the meeting we can use the time to discuss additional items.

## Self-Hosted Runners
Discussion on the current state and plans for self-hosted runners infrastructure for spdk-ci.

- Michael (HPE) is working on adding self-hosted runners.
- Simon (Samsung) has secured resources for a pool of self-hosted runners in the future.
- Boris (Dell) has set up access to the OPI lab for SPDK.
- Ben (Nvidia) confirmed plans to restore CI and move it to a GitHub Actions-based approach.
- Tomek (Nutanix) will provide a description of the current approach for GitHub workflows and self-hosted runners as a README on the spdk-ci repository.

## spdk-ci Development Process
Until spdk-ci is operational and voting on patches, a more relaxed approach will be taken on pull requests submitted to that repository.
This is crucial for restoring the process for merging patches to SPDK proper.
