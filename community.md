# Community Meetings

SPDK Community meetings are open to everyone and all are encouraged to
participate. The primary purpose is to cover topics where verbal communication
is more efficient than email or Slack. The meetings are hosted using Teams.

There is a community meeting each week at alternating time slots selected so
that one week is a Euro-friendly time and the following week is an
Asia-friendly time. For Asia-friendly time slots Community meetings, one Community
meeting is held in English, and the following is held in Mandarin for PRC only.
Please see the bottom of this [page](#holidays) for holidays when regularly
scheduled community meetings will be cancelled.

Please post proposed topics for community meetings on the Community Meeting
[board](https://github.com/orgs/spdk/projects/1) prior to the meeting. If we are able to cover the
posted topics before the end of the meeting we can use the time to discuss additional items.

There are also Github issue review meetings that are held in each respective time zone on the
week where there is no community meeting for that geo. Note that bugs are tracked on the [SPDK GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/issues).
