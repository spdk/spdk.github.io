# IRC

Join us on the [freenode](https://freenode.net/) IRC network in the [#spdk](irc://irc.freenode.net/%23spdk) ([Archive](https://ci.spdk.io/irclog/?C=N;O=D)) channel.

# Trello Board

Find something to work on at the Things To Do Board, or start/participate in a design discussion on any of the [SPDK Trello Boards](https://trello.com/spdk).

# Mailing List

The [SPDK Mailing List](https://lists.01.org/mailman/listinfo/spdk) ([Archive](https://lists.01.org/pipermail/spdk/))
is available for usage and development questions as well as design discussions.

# Community Meetings

SPDK Community meetings are open to everyone and all are encouraged to participate.

* Meetings are weekly, alternating time zones to accommodate our global presence.
* Primary purpose is to cover those things where verbal communication is easier/more
efficient than email or IRC.
* Post any topics on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/DvM7XayJ) prior to the meeting. If you don't have a Trello login, it's free just sign up and then ask someone on IRC or on the distribution list to add you to the board.
* If we are able to cover the posted topics before the end of the meeting we can use the time to discuss ad-hoc items.
* Meetings will be hosted with WebEx every week alternating between Tue UTC 15:00-16:00 and Thu UTC 04:00-5:00.

Announcements will be made on IRC as a reminder of which meeting time we are on each week.
