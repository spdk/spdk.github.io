# Community Meetings

SPDK Community meetings are open to everyone and all are encouraged to
participate. The primary purpose is to cover topics where verbal communication
is more efficient than email or Slack. The meetings are hosted using Teams.

There is a bi-weekly community meeting at Euro-friendly time slots.
Please see the bottom of this [page](#holidays) for holidays when regularly
scheduled community meetings will be cancelled.

Please post proposed topics for community meetings on the Community Meeting
[board](https://github.com/orgs/spdk/projects/1) prior to the meeting. If we are able to cover the
posted topics before the end of the meeting we can use the time to discuss additional items.

There are also Github issue review meetings that are held on the following week of the community
meeting. Note that bugs are tracked on the [SPDK GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/issues).
