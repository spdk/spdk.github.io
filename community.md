# Trello Board

Find something to work on the backlog in your area of interest, or start/participate in a design discussion on any of the [SPDK Trello Boards](../trello/).

# Mailing List

The [SPDK Mailing List](https://lists.01.org/mailman/listinfo/spdk) ([Archive](https://lists.01.org/pipermail/spdk/))
is available for usage and development questions as well as design discussions.

# Community Meetings

SPDK Community meetings are open to everyone and all are encouraged to
participate. The primary purpose is to cover topics where verbal communication
is more efficient than email or IRC. The meetings are hosted on WebEx.

There is a community meeting each week in alternating time slots selected so
that one week is a Euro-friendly time and the following week is an
Asia-friendly time.

The p.a.s.s.w.o.r.d (not to be confused with the access code) for all community meetings
including the bug scrub is:
