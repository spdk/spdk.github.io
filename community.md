# Slack

For real-time discussions, join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/spdk-team/shared_invite/enQtNjM0NDcxNzQyNzM3LWQ3M2FjZDgzMmU5MjkyZWU5MDRhMGZkNGY3ZjM1YjhhODkyZmRkYWNjODk1YTdiZDMxNzJjNzc0NTEyMTVhYTM).

# Trello Board

Find something to work on the backlog in your area of interest, or start/participate in a design discussion on any of the [SPDK Trello Boards](../trello/).

# Mailing List

The [SPDK Mailing List](https://lists.01.org/mailman/listinfo/spdk) ([Archive](https://lists.01.org/pipermail/spdk/))
is available for usage and development questions as well as design discussions.

# Community Meetings

SPDK Community meetings are open to everyone and all are encouraged to
participate. The primary purpose is to cover topics where verbal communication
is more efficient than email or IRC. The meetings are hosted using
[FreeConferenceCall](https://www.freeconferencecall.com).

There is a community meeting each week at alternating time slots selected so
that one week is a Euro-friendly time and the following week is an
Asia-friendly time. Please see the bottom of this [page](#holidays) for holidays
when regularly scheduled community meetings will be cancelled.

Please post proposed topics for community meetings on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/DvM7XayJ)
prior to the meeting. If you don't have a Trello login, sign up and then ask in IRC
or on the mailing list to to be added to the board. If we are able to cover
the posted topics before the end of the meeting we can use the time to discuss
additional items.

There are also Github issue review meetings that are held in each respective time zone on the
week where there is no community meeting for that geo. Note that bugs are tracked on the [SPDK GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/issues).

All meetings use the same conference information. It is shown below in a
slightly distored image to help prevent bots from joining our calls. Adding
a bookmark with the link below should make it easy to join weekly.
