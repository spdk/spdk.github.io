# Slack

For real-time discussions, join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/spdk-team/shared_invite/enQtNzg2NTgxNTgzNzEyLWQ2Y2NmOGFkN2FlYjczMWY1ZDZiMzFjZTI4ZGIyZDc0YTA3ZjE5YWQ3MGVjYzI1MTg0OGYzMjFhZDczZDYwZmY).

# Enhancement Requests

# Community Meetings

SPDK Community Meetings are weekly calls open to everyone and all are encouraged to
participate. The primary purpose is to cover topics where verbal communication
is more efficient than Slack. The meetings are hosted using Zoom.

Please see the bottom of this [page](#holidays) for holidays when regularly
scheduled community meetings will be cancelled.

Please post proposed topics on the SPDK Community Meeting
[board](https://github.com/orgs/spdk/projects/8/views/1?pane=info) prior to the meeting. If we are able to cover the
posted topics before the end of the meeting we can use the time to discuss additional items.
