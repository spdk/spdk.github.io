# Community Meetings

SPDK Community meetings are open to everyone and all are encouraged to participate. Here are the details:

Meetings are weekly, alternating time zones to accommodate our global presence.
Primary purpose is to cover those things where verbal communication is easier/more efficient than email or IRC. See the Community page for details on other communications channels.
Post any topics on Trello prior to the meeting.
If we are able to cover the posted topics before the end of the meeting we can use the time to discuss ad-hoc items.
Meetings will be hosted with WebEx.
Every other Wed: UTC 04:00-05:00 Every other Thu: UTC 16:00-17:00

Announcements will be made on IRC as a reminder of which meeting time we are on each week.
