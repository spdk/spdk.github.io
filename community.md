# SPDK Developer Meetup - Nov 2017

Come and join the very first SPDK Developer Meetup! Itâ€™s an excellent
opportunity for networking, learning and making forward progress on
the code and generally making the community more productive.
There won't be any presentations at this meeting, instead be prepared
for the following types of activities:

- open discussion / brainstorming new features or process improvements
- white board design work
- code walkthroughs
- focused work on getting specific patches approved

We'll kick off the meeting with some agenda building work and then break
off in as many groups as makes sense based on the topics that have the most
interest. Seating is limited so please RSVP as soon as possible!!  We're
scheduling things to try and make it possible for most to fly in Monday
morning and out Wednesday afternoon. Intel will be providing lunch and
snacks Tue/Wed and we'll all go out for a group dinner Tue evening.

DATES: Mon 11/6 start at 1:00 through Wed 11/8 end at 1:00
