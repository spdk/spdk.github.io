It is the hope that those bugfixes will be eventually accepted in their respective upstream repositories and for the next major SPDK release (x.x), when we can finally switch to a newer submodule version (via a separate branch in our fork), we won\u0027t have to cherry-pick those fixes again as they will be already included in upstream.",
