      "message": "Shuhei\nThe first link under documentation does not point to the report location. \nHow about we reword this blog to add some information on the purpose and a summary of the results?\nHere is what I am thinking. \n\nWe have been doing some work to evaluate the performance of SPDK and gain some hands-on experience with the SPDK NVMe-oF Target and Initiator. The [Hitachi SPDK NVMe-oF Performance Report](https://ci.spdk.io/download/papers/Hitachi_SPDK_NVMe_oF_Performance_Report.pdf)\ncontains our test configuration and performance results. In summary, we observed up to 8x more IOPS/Core with SPDK NVMe-oF Target and Initiator, vs the Linux Kernel, \nand a 90% reduction in the software latency. Many thanks to John Kariuki and the SPDK team.",
