      "message": "Assuming I understand the flow correctly, would you please wordsmith this a little further to make clear that it is *after* the release, that the forks are updated to point to their respective upstream repositories -- not really \"at SPDK release time\"; or, more specifically, updated in master.   Unless I am wrong, when we cut a SPDK release, at that instant the forks associated with the released SPDK tag/branch still are pointing to the previous versions of the submodules\u0027 repos plus our patches.   However, on SPDK\u0027s master, our forks to the upstream repos are updated following the release.   That\u0027s the way it works today, right?   Assuming so, I want to ensure people reading this are not left with the impression that the forks to other repos have been updated in the released tag/branch of the SPDK -- but instead only in master going forward toward the next quarterly SPDK release.",

      "message": "The way things have been operating, for as long as I know anyway, is that as you state an SPDK release is made with the prev DPDK release using our DPDK fork.  Then we do a dot release to the latest DPDK version which is done by pointing our fork to the latest and then applying any DPDK patches that we still need to carry to that fork.  The dot release is then done based on the DPDK fork.\n\nDoes that make sense? Darek, Ben please free to comment",

The SPDK maintenance releases can only include new bugfixes to existing and currently used branches.\n\n\nLance, does that clarification suffice?",

For example:  instead of only stating:   \"..SPDK release is made with the previous DPDK release using our DPDK fork.\", I\u0027d like it to state \"...SPDK release is made using our DPDK fork derived from the previous *major* DPDK release.\"  This eliminates any possible confusion the reader might have if they visit the DPDK site and see references to \"latest stable\" release.",
