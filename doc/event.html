<div class="textblock"><p>SPDK provides a framework for writing asynchronous, polled-mode, shared-nothing server applications. The event framework is intended to be optional; most other SPDK components are designed to be integrated into an application without specifically depending on the SPDK event library. The framework defines several concepts - reactors, events, and pollers - that are described in the following sections. The event framework spawns one thread per core (reactor) and connects the threads with lockless queues. Messages (events) can then be passed between the threads. On modern CPU architectures, message passing is often much faster than traditional locking.</p>
<p>The event framework public interface is defined in <a class="el" href="event_8h.html" title="Event framework public API. ">spdk/event.h</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="event_design"></a>
Event Framework Design Considerations</h1>
<p>Simple server applications can be written in a single-threaded fashion. This allows for straightforward code that can maintain state without any locking or other synchronization. However, to scale up (for example, to allow more simultaneous connections), the application may need to use multiple threads. In the ideal case where each connection is independent from all other connections, the application can be scaled by creating additional threads and assigning connections to them without introducing cross-thread synchronization. Unfortunately, in many real-world cases, the connections are not entirely independent and cross-thread shared state is necessary. SPDK provides an event framework to help solve this problem.</p>

SPDK Event Framework Components</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="event_component_events"></a>
Events</h2>
<p>To accomplish cross-thread communication while minimizing synchronization overhead, the framework provides message passing in the form of events. The event framework runs one event loop thread per CPU core. These threads are called reactors, and their main responsibility is to process incoming events from a queue. Each event consists of a bundled function pointer and its arguments, destined for a particular CPU core. Events are created using <a class="el" href="event_8h.html#a885e8b94b71844c94f0b380afdfa0df9" title="Allocate an event to be passed to spdk_event_call. ">spdk_event_allocate()</a> and executed using <a class="el" href="event_8h.html#af17b7963b6a6964e5eb18480193acedb" title="Pass the given event to the associated lcore and call the function. ">spdk_event_call()</a>. Unlike a thread-per-connection server design, which achieves concurrency by depending on the operating system to schedule many threads issuing blocking I/O onto a limited number of cores, the event-driven model requires use of explicitly asynchronous operations to achieve concurrency. Asynchronous I/O may be issued with a non-blocking function call, and completion is typically signaled using a callback function.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="event_component_reactors"></a>
Reactors</h2>
<p>Each reactor has a lock-free queue for incoming events to that core, and threads from any core may insert events into the queue of any other core. The reactor loop running on each core checks for incoming events and executes them in first-in, first-out order as they are received. Event functions should never block and should preferably execute very quickly, since they are called directly from the event loop on the destination core.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="event_component_pollers"></a>
Pollers</h2>
<p>The framework also defines another type of function called a poller. Pollers may be registered with the <a class="el" href="event_8h.html#a8621af2d872087cd8518ef93391a8fff" title="Register a poller on the given lcore. ">spdk_poller_register()</a> function. Pollers, like events, are functions with arguments that can be bundled and sent to a specific core to be executed. However, unlike events, pollers are executed repeatedly until unregistered. The reactor event loop intersperses calls to the pollers with other event processing. Pollers are intended to poll hardware as a replacement for interrupts. Normally, pollers are executed on every iteration of the main event loop. Pollers may also be scheduled to execute periodically on a timer if low latency is not required.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="event_component_app"></a>
Application Framework</h2>
<p>The framework itself is bundled into a higher level abstraction called an "app". Once <a class="el" href="event_8h.html#a18879873a585b21f44b7c90be8726ce1" title="Start the framework. ">spdk_app_start()</a> is called, it will block the current thread until the application terminates by calling <a class="el" href="event_8h.html#a40f3af1c0340f5c3eb915bc43e3cee83" title="Stop the framework. ">spdk_app_stop()</a>. </p>
