Software Quality can mean a lot of different things to different people. Most developers equate quality to testing which is very reasonable.  But in the SPDK Community it’s about much more than just testing, it’s about automation, code reviews, and clear communication to name just a few. This talk will provide a bird’s eye view of the SPDK automated testing infrastructure and how it’s evolved over the years. We will also demonstrate how developer interactions are another key to SPDK’s continued commitment to quality.

<p>
Have you ever wondered if your system is configured well for its typical loads? Or if your typical workloads are well optimized for your system? Will your workloads benefit from Intel Optane DC persistent memory? State of the art performance analysis tools, for longer runs, do not always give sufficiently detailed performance metrics. More detailed performance analysis tools can overwhelm the user with huge amount of fine-grained data. Intel® VTune™ Amplifier’s Platform Profiler provides an adequate amount of data for a user to detect if there is any problem with the system configuration, or if there is any pressure on specific system components like memory or I/O that cause performance bottlenecks.  This presentation focuses on how to use Intel® VTune™ Amplifier Platform Profiler for (1) Analyzing suitability of your workload for Intel® Optane™ DC PMM and (2) Analyzing performance on an Intel® Optane™ DC PMM enabled system.

<b>Flexible and Dynamic Resource Use with SPDK</b><br/>
<br/>
Ben Walker and Darek Stojaczyk<br/>
Intel Corp<br/>
<br/>
<p>
SPDK was originally designed to run in a model where all memory was allocated up front, a system thread was spawned per CPU core, and the process was executed with elevated privileges. While suitable for a large number of use cases, a more flexible and dynamic model is required especially for use within cloud deployments. Today, SPDK supports fully dynamic memory allocation, a new flexible threading model design to integrate seamlessly into existing code bases, and full support for running without elevated privileges. This talk will cover that transformation process and outline how to take advantage of all of SPDK’s new-found flexibility in your application.

<b>Is your data really persistent?  Or did you forget to flush?</b><br/>
<br/>
Kevin P O'leary<br/>
Intel Corp<br/>
<br/>
<p>
Data cannot persist when power is removed unless it is actually written to persistent memory.  It must be flushed from volatile caches.  Flush too little and you lose data.  Too much and you reduce performance.  Intel Inspector’s Persistence Inspector finds persistent memory errors like missing and redundant cache flushes, missing store fences, out of order persistent memory stores and PMDK transaction logging errors.  Come learn how it can be used both as a design tool to find the best spot to insert flushes and as a performance tool to eliminate redundant flushes.

<b>Hardware offloads for SPDK</b><br/>
<br/>
Sasha Kotchubievsky and Oren Duer<br/>
Mellanox<br/>
<br/>
<p>
A SmartNIC is a NIC with on-board processing units, that can run software. Such a SmartNIC can present to the host a standard NVMe device, while implementing the device logic, using software on the SmartNIC's processors. Use cases include: bare-metal and virtual cloud providers; storage systems with proprietary protocols; storage devices security and isolation; compression and encryption over the standard NVMe interface and more. SPDK is a great match as a framework for the software processing on the SmartNIC.
</p><p>
NVME-OF target offload is a hardware implementation of the NVME-OF RDMA protocol at the network card. Employing this technology, the network adapter terminates the target side of NVME-OF protocol and submits the NVME requests directly to NVME devices over PCI using peer-to-peer. Integrating this technology with SPDK will allow users to manage such configurations from a known and flexible environment.

Shuhei Matsumoto<br/>
Hitachi<br/>
<br/>
<p>
Dealing with data corruption is important for storage applications, including those built on SPDK.  This presentation will describe the new SPDK DIF library and its use cases in SPDK.  The library leverages the Intel® Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library (ISA-L) for efficient CRC calculations and provides routines to simplify integration of DIF operations into other libraries.  The SPDK iSCSI target now leverages this DIF library to support insert/strip for read and write I/O.  This demonstrates that end-to-end data protection can be implemented in host software without specialized hardware while still providing compelling performance and efficiency.

Intel® Optane™ DC persistent memory can be configured either as persistent memory (AppDirect) or as main memory, with DRAM used as a cache (memory mode).  Each mode has some challenges for adoption. To extract the best performance from this memory technology and identify which configuration mode is best suited for your application, it is necessary to understand the architectural flow from the core to the memory and some key challenges in optimization. In this presentation, we will present an overview of the uncore architecture leading to architectural conditions to monitor when using Intel® Optane™ DC persistent memory in both memory configurations . This presentation will also cover recommendations on what tools/profiles to use for profiling. With the relevant architectural background and the recommendation on what tools/profiles to use, profiling and optimizing applications will be that much easier!

<b>Integrating SPDK with Oracle RDBMS</b><br/>

Akshay Shah and Zahra Khatami <br/>
Oracle<br/>
<br/>
<p>
The goal of integrating Oracle database with SPDK is to build highly available and scalable applications where the database is serving millions of IOPS at very low latencies. However, there are a few challenges with integrating SPDK with the Oracle database. The multi-process Oracle database architecture quickly exhausts the PCIe hardware queues. The DPDK memory model conflicts with Oracle's shared memory model and introduces inefficiencies in the RDMA data access path.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, we will go over the Oracle dispatcher and Oracle environment abstraction layer (EAL) design and implementation. Additionally, we will also describe other enhancements that enhance the security model for SPDK memory management, provide better isolation between different databases and improve the fault tolerance of the database. These features help address the above challenges and enable creation of an enterprise-grade solution that can unlock the full potential of the NVMe devices. Lastly, we will talk about some of the deployment and packaging related challenges with delivering this solution for on premise and cloud deployments.

<b>Debugging Techniques for Persistent Memory Programming</b><br/>
<br/>
Eduardo Berrocal<br/>
Intel Corp<br/>
<br/>
<p>
In this talk, Eduardo will go over the new potential errors that persistent memory programmers need to be aware of and the tools available to overcome them. The first part of the talk will focus on pmempool, a tool available in the Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) that helps prevent, diagnose, and recover from unplanned data corruption due to hardware issues. Eduardo will also show how errors can be injected to test the redundancy of your system. The second part will focus on the new types of bugs that can arise in persistent memory programming, and how you can protect yourself using the pmemcheck, pmreorder, and Intel® Inspector – Persistent Inspector tools.

<b>RMI: High performance user-level multi-threading on SPDK/DPDK</b><br/>
<br/>
Munenori Maeda and Shinji KobayashI<br/>
Fujitsu<br/>
<br/>
<p>
Our two-years practice to develop an Enterprise AFA storage with high-speed RDMA reveals that its complicated storage stack requires a threading environment to reduce implementation complexity. However, it is a big challenge to implement a threading environment including synchronous communication primitives without degrading the performance of SPDK/DPDK.
</p><p>
RMI threading environment, we have developed on SPDK 16.12, supports over 16K threads, and provides dynamic load-balancing and simple synchronous communication primitives using RDMA. Our preliminary evaluation show that the cost of load balancing is quite low, and the communication performance scales well on modern multicore systems.

<b>OpenStack, NVMe-over-Fabrics and SPDK – High Performance Pooled Block Storage with Cinder</b><br/>
<br/>
Maciej Szwed and Tushar Gohad<br/>
Intel Corp<br/>
<br/>
<p>
NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) is an architecture that allows low latency access over RDMA and TCP to remote NVMe-attached storage.  It is fast becoming a key enabler for disaggregated storage and NVMe pooling in data centers, driving increased storage efficiency. Intel, Mellanox and Mirantis joined forces to enable NVMe-oF in Openstack Cinder and Nova - a new SPDK NVMe-oF driver was recently merged to upstream, which paves the way for consuming SPDK-based high performance storage in OpenStack (and soon to be enabled, Kubernetes) cloud deployments.

<b>Oops!  Most profilers can’t analyze SPDK polled I/O.  Learn how Intel® VTune™ Amplifier can. </b><br/>
<br/>
Roman Sudarikov, Ilya Kurakin, Roman Khatko, and Jeffrey Reinemann<br/>
Intel Corp<br/>
<br/>
<p>
With traditional interrupt driven I/O, the CPU is either doing something useful or waiting.  With SPDK’s polled I/O the CPU is always 100% busy so traditional profiling techniques don’t work.  Intel VTune Amplifier can identify “empty” spinning so you can balance core loading, balance SSDs, see the throughput per device, PCIe traffic breakdown and lots of good stuff.  Learn how to use Intel VTune Amplifier to optimize your I/O performance.

<b>Pachyzoom: Understanding & Optimizing Hadoop servers with Intel VPP</b><br/>
<br/>
Matt Singer<br/>
Twitter<br/>
<br/>
<p>
Twitter partnered with Intel to investigate options to increase the storage density of Hadoop nodes.  The project began with a focus on iCAS and Optane SSDs, but evolved into a deeper dive into Twitter's existing Hadoop infrastructure using Intel's vTune Platform Profiler and internal tooling.  As bottlenecks were removed, new ones took their place, causing a shift in the focus of our testing.  By collaborating with experts from both companies on Hadoop, storage, caching and telemetry, we were able to challenge several assumptions about Twitter's desired compute/storage balance.  The result of many months of reconfiguration, benchmark testing, and analysis resulted in a clear direction for the shape of Twitter's next generation of Hadoop hardware.  The presentation will discuss the evolution of the project and key results of the collaboration.

<b>Squeezing Compression into SPDK</b><br/>
<br/>
Paul Luse and Jim Harris<br/>
Intel Corp<br/>
<br/>
<p>
Last year we introduced the crypto bdev module which made use of DPDK’s existing variety of drivers to usher in the capability. This year we are expanding our use of DPDK with the addition of a compression bdev module. This talk will outline the overall architecture of the compression module and explain in detail how we are managing the layout of the device and leveraging PMDK to store metadata in super-fast persistent memory.

<b>Big data usages with PMDK</b><br/>
<br/>
Di Wang and Jakub Radtke<br/>
Intel Corp<br/>
<br/>
<p>
The Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS) is an open-source software-defined object store designed from the ground up for massively distributed Non Volatile Memory (NVM). In this presentation, Di will introduce DAOS architecture and how DAOS is built based on PMDK.
</p><p>
DAOS takes advantage of next generation NVM technology like Storage Class Memory (SCM) and NVM express (NVMe) while presenting a key-value storage interface and providing features such as transactional non-blocking I/O, advanced data protection with self-healing on top of commodity hardware, end-to-end data integrity, fine grained data control and elastic storage to optimize performance and cost.
</p><p>
The second part talks about the main challenge in the design of key-value store for DAQ is handling the bandwidth and capacity requirements. D
