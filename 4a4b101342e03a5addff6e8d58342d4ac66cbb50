      "message": "this is probably ok but in my experience its not squashing that\u0027s needed, its breaking patches up into smaller pieces\n\ni think usually squashing comes in when there\u0027s a set of patches and the intermediate ones don\u0027t build/run - only the final one does - that\u0027s where squashing is needed to provide a fully functional incremental step",

Note that I didn\u0027t add this, I just changed the wording from \"rewrite your local branch\u0027s history\" as squash is the git term and the only thing I\u0027ve ever heard before.",
